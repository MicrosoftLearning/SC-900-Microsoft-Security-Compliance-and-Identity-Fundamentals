# Demo: Sensitivity labels in Microsoft Purview

This demo maps to the following Learn content:

- Learning Path: Describe the capabilities of Microsoft compliance
- Module: Describe information protection, data lifecycle management, and data governance capabilities in Microsoft Purview
- Unit: Describe sensitivity labels

## Demo scenario

In this demo, you'll show the capabilities of sensitivity labels.  You'll go through the settings for existing sensitivity labels that have been created and the corresponding policy to publish the label.   Then you'll see how to apply a label and the impact of that label, from the perspective of a user.  **NOTE**: The first time you use Word online with your Microsoft 365 tenant, it can take 15 minutes for the Sensitivity option to appear on the ribbon.  Presenters should run demo part 2 before class to ensure sufficient time for the option to appear.

### Demo Part 1

In this demo, you show the settings for an existing sensitivity label and the corresponding policy to publish the label.

1. Open the browser tab for home page of Microsoft Purview.  If you previously closed it, open a browser tab and enter **https://admin.microsoft.com**. Sign in with the admin credentials for the Microsoft 365 tenant provided by the authorized lab hoster (ALH). From the left navigation pane of the Microsoft 365 admin center, select **Show all** then select **Compliance**.  A new browser page opens to the welcome page of the Microsoft Purview compliance portal.  

1. In the left navigation panel, under solutions, expand **Information protection** then select **Overview**.  The overview page includes information about top sensitivity labels applied to content, top activities detected, locations where sensitivity labels are applied and more.  
    1. On the overview page, you may see a yellow information box indicating that your organization has not turned on the ability to process content in Office online files that have encrypted sensitivity labels applied and are stored in OneDrive and SharePoint.  Select **Turn on now**.  Once you do this, there can be a delay for the setting to propagate through the system.

1. From the left navigation panel, select **Labels**.

1. Some labels have been preconfigured in your Microsoft 365 lab tenant, for your convenience. Select the label named **Confidential-Finance**.  A window opens that provides information about this label.  Note the settings for this label.  Select **Edit label** (it may also show as a pencil icon) at the top of the page to view some of the basic configuration settings. If you don't see this option, select the ellipsis.
    1. Configuration starts with providing a name and description for your label.  Don’t change anything.  Select **Next** at the bottom of the page.
    1. Review the scope for this label. Don’t change anything.  Select **Next** at the bottom of the page.

        1. On the content markings page, take note of the information box on the top of the page.  Don’t change any settings.  Select **Next** on the bottom of the page.
    1. You are now in the Auto-labeling for files and emails window.  Read the description of auto-labeling on the top of the page and the information box below it.  Also take note that this label is set for auto-labeling for specific conditions. Don’t change any settings.  Select **Next** on the bottom of the page.
    1. This window defines protection settings for teams, groups, and sites that have this label applied. This is not enabled, select **Next** on the bottom of the page.
    1. This window is a preview feature to automatically apply this label to schematized data assets in Microsoft Purview Data Map (such as SQL, Synapse, and more) that contain the sensitive info types you choose.  This feature is not enabled. Select **Cancel** at the bottom of the page to exit the label configuration wizard and return to the Information Protection page.

1. From the left navigation panel, select **Label policies**.  It is through label policies that sensitivity labels can be published.  The Microsoft 365 tenant has been configured with some label policies, for your convenience.

1. From the left navigation panel, under Information protection, select Auto-labeling. Review the description.
