## Lab scenario

In this lab, you'll access Microsoft Entra ID (previously referred to as Azure Active Directory).  Additionally, you'll create a user and configure the different settings, including adding licenses.

    1. When prompted to stay signed- in, select **Yes**.

1. Under Admin centers, select **Identity** (you may need to select **Show all** and scroll down).  A new browser page opens to the overview page of the Microsoft Entra admin center. Here you will see basic information about your Contoso tenant. If you scroll down the main window you will also see information about alerts, my feed, feature highlights, and more.

1. From the left navigation pane, expand **Users** then select **All users**. Notice that your tenant is already configured with users.

1. From the top of the page, select **+ New user** then from the drop-down box, select **Create new user**.

### Review

In this lab, you started your initial exploration of Azure AD. Since subscribers to Microsoft 365 are automatically using Azure AD, you found that you access Azure AD features and services through either the Microsoft 365 admin portal or through the Azure portal.  Whichever approach you prefer to get to the same place.  You also walked through the process of creating a new user and the different setting that can be configured, including groups to which the user can be assigned, the availability of roles, and assigning of user licenses.
