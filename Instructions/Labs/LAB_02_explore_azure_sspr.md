# Lab: Explore Azure AD Authentication with self-service password reset

## Lab scenario

In this lab, you, as an admin, will walk through the process of enabling self-service password reset. With SSPR enabled, you will then assume the role of a user and go through the process of registering for SSPR and also resetting your password.  Lastly, you as the admin, will be able to view audit logs and usage data & insights for SSPR.

**Estimated Time**: 15-20 minutes

### Task 1

In this task you, as the admin, will add an existing user, Adele Vance, into the SSPRSecurityUsers group.  Also, you will also need to do a reset of the user’s password so that you can do a first-time login, as the user, and register for SSPR.

1. Open Microsoft Edge.

2. In the address bar enter **portal.azure.com** and sign in with your admin credentials.
    1. In the Sign in window enter **admin@WWLxZZZZZZ.onmicrosoft.com** (where ZZZZZZ is your unique tenant ID provided by your lab hosting provider) then select **Next**.
    1. Enter the admin password which should be provided by your lab hosting provider. Select **Sign in**.
    1. When prompted to stay signed- in, select **Yes**.

3. Select **Azure Active Directory**.  

4. From the left navigation panel, select **Groups**.

11. From the left navigation panel select **Users**.

12. Select **Adele Vance** from the list of users.

13. Select **Reset password** from the top of the page. Since you have not previously signed in as Adele Vance, you will need to reset the password

15. Close the password reset window by selecting the **X** at the top right corner of the page.

16. Close the Adele Vance window by selecting the **X** at the top right corner of the page.

17. Close the Users window by selecting the **X** at the top right corner of the page.

18. Keep the  Contoso Overview window open as you will use it in the subsequent task.

### Task 2

In this task you, as the admin, will learn how to configure Password reset for users, including configuration of the types of authentication methods to use

1. Go to the Contoso – Microsoft Azure tab that is open on your browser. If you previously closed the tab, open a browser page and in the address bar, enter portal.azure.com and select Azure Active Directory.  You should be logged in as admin, in the Azure portal, if not, sign back in.

1. From the left navigation pane, select **Password reset**.  

1. The properties for self service password reset are displayed.  Ensure that **Self service reset** is **selected** for the group which is listed, the **SSPRSecurityGroupUsers**.  Put your cursor over the information icon next to where it says "select group" and note what is says, "Defines the group of users who are allowed to reset their own passwords." You must include users in the group, you can’t individually select users.  Also, if you change the group, then the group you select replaces the group currently listed.  As such, it is recommended that you simply add users to the SSPR group.  Lastly, note the blue information box, "These settings only apply to end users in your organization. Admins are always enabled for self-service password reset and are required to use two authentication methods to reset their password."

1. From the left navigation panel of Password reset, select **Authentication Methods**.

1. In the Number of methods required to rest, select **1**. Note the information box on the screen.

1. Notice the different methods available to users.  **Email** and **Mobile phone (SMS only)** should already be checked; if not, select them.

1. Ensure the setting to Require users to register when signing in is set to **Yes**.  Leave the Number of days before users are asked to re-confirm their authentication information, to the default of 180.   Take note of the information box on the page.

1. From the left navigation panel of Password reset, select **Notifications**.  

1. Ensure the setting to Notify users on password resets is set to **Yes**.  Leave the setting for Notify all admins when other admins reset their password to No.

1. Note how the Password reset navigation pane also includes options to view audit logs and Usage & insights.

1. **Sign out** from all the browser tabs by clicking on the user icon next to the email address on the top right corner of the screen. Then the close all the browser windows.

### Task 3

1. Open Microsoft Edge.

2. In the address bar enter **login.microsoftonline.com**.

3. Sign in as Adele Vance,
    1. In the Sign in window enter **AdeleV@WWLxZZZZZZ.onmicrosoft.com** (where ZZZZZZ is your unique tenant ID provided by your lab hosting provider) then select **Next**.

    1. When prompted to stay signed- in, select **Yes**

4. Since this is your first sign in as Adele Vance, you will be prompted to reset your password.  Enter your old password.  For your new password enter **SC900-Lab**. Enter **SC-900-Lab** in the confirm password field.  Select **Sign in**.  Note: we are using this password only for the convenience of the lab. As a best practice you would typically enter a more secure password.

5. A pop-up displays indicating that More information is required.  This is because as a member of the SSPRSecurityGroupUsers group, the configuration requires its members to register when they sign in.  Select the **Next** button.  Note:  An alternative to having users do the registration, themselves, is for admins to directly configure the authentication methods when they add a user. This requires admins to know and set the ​phone numbers and email addresses that users use to perform self-service password reset, and reset a user’s password.

6. The “Keep your account secure” page opens.  The window that appears is for the Phone authentication method, if you don’t have a mobile device with you that is capable of receiving text messages, skip to the next step.  You are prompted to enter a phone number. Ensure the option **Text me a code** is enabled.   Enter the phone number where you can receive a text code and select the **Next button**.  A new window opens indicating a code was just sent to the phone you entered.  Enter the code your received and select **Next**. A window opens indicating Success and showing your Default sign-in method.  Select **Done**.  

7. Skip this step if you were able to configure SSPR with your mobile phone number.  Alternatively, you can setup a different method as shown on the bottom left of the window.  If you choose to setup a different method, select **I want to set up a different method**, a pop-up window shows up, asking Which method would you like to use?  From the drop down, select your preferred method, **Email**, then select the **Confirm** button.  Enter the email you would like to use then select **Next**.  A new window opens indicating a code was just sent to the email you entered.  Access the email you entered to obtain the code.  Enter the code your received and select **Next**. A window opens indicating Success and showing your Default sign-in method.  Select **Done**.

8. You can now complete your sign in.  You should be on the azure portal landing page.  If you see that your sign in time has expired, just reenter the password, SC900-Lab.

9. Sign-out of the Azure portal and close your browser window.
