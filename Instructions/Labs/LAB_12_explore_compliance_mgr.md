In this lab, you'll explore the Microsoft Purview compliance portal home page and ways in which the capabilities of Compliance Manager can help organizations improve their compliance posture.

**Estimated Time**: 30-45 minutes

### Task 1

Explore the Microsoft Purview compliance portal home page and learn to customize the card view and the navigation panel.

1. Open Microsoft Edge. In the address bar, enter **admin.microsoft.com**.
1. Sign in with your admin credentials.
    1. In the Sign in window, enter **admin@WWLxZZZZZZ.onmicrosoft.com** (where ZZZZZZ is your unique tenant ID provided by your lab hosting provider) then select **Next**.
    1. Enter the admin password that should be provided by your lab hosting provider. Select **Sign in**.
    1. When prompted to stay signed- in, select **Yes**. This takes you to the Microsoft 365 admin center page.

1. From the left navigation pane of the Microsoft 365 admin center, select **Show all**.

1. Under Admin centers, select **Compliance**.  A new browser page opens to the welcome page of the Microsoft Purview compliance portal.  

1. The card section on the home page shows you, at a glance, how your organization is doing with your compliance posture, what solutions are available for your organization, and more.

1. From the main window, scroll down to view the different cards. The cards available on the home screen and the position of the cards can be changed to accommodate each administrator’s preference.  

1. Placing your mouse cursor over the title bar of any card turns the title bar grey.  When you see the cursor turn into a cross shape, you can move the card to your desired location.

1. On the title bar of every card, you'll also see an ellipsis that provides actions you can take.  Select the ellipses on the Solution catalog and select **Remove**.

1. You can add cards, by selecting **+ Add cards**.  The Add cards to your home page window opens.  Place your mouse cursor over the card shown in this window and drag it over to the location on your home screen where you want the card to be positioned.

1. From the left navigation panel of the Microsoft Purview compliance portal home page, notice the items listed under Solutions.  

1. As the compliance admin, there may be a set of solutions that you manage for our organization and as such, you may want to have only those solutions listed in the navigation panel that you see. To customize to your preferences select **Customize navigation**.  

1. From the window labeled Customize your navigation pane, note how you can select the items you want to have appear on the navigation panel and de-select the items you don't want to see. For the purpose of these labs, keep all items selected and hit **Save** on the bottom of the window.  

1. Leave the browser tab open.

### Task 2

Learn about your organization’s compliance posture through Compliance Manager.

1. From the left navigation panel of the Microsoft Purview compliance portal, select **Compliance Manager**.  Alternatively, you can select Compliance Manager on the title bar of the Compliance Manager card.

1. From the top of the Compliance Manager page, ensure **Overview** is selected (underlined). Scroll down to see all the information available on the page.  Information on this page includes your compliance score, your points achieved, and Microsoft managed points achieved.   You'll see Key improvement actions, Solutions that affect your score and compliance score breakdown by categories.

1. From the top of the Overview page, select **Improvement actions**.  These are actions that can improve the organization’s compliance score. Note that as improvement actions are taken, points may take up to 24 hours to update.  Notice the available filters.

1. From the list of improvement actions, select **Enable self-service password reset**.  Review the available information for the improvement action.  The left side of the window provides a brief overview about the implementation, test status, and more. To the right of the overview is the details page from which you can select implementation, testing, the related standards and regulatory requirements, and documents. Each of these tabs provides more detailed information for the improvement action.

1. Exit out of this improvement action by selecting **Improvement Actions** from the breadcrumb on the top-left of the page.  You're now back on the improvement actions page.

1. From the top of the page, select **Solutions**. On this page, you'll see how solutions contribute to your score and their remaining opportunity for improvement.

1. From the top of the page, select **Assessments**. On this page, you'll see the Data Protection Baseline for Microsoft 365.  This is a default baseline assessment Microsoft provides in Compliance Manager for Microsoft 365.  This baseline assessment has a set of controls for key regulations and standards for data protection and general data governance. Compliance Manager becomes more helpful as you add your own assessments to meet your organization's particular needs.

1. Select **Data Protection Baseline**.  Notice the information available on the progress tab.  You can also view information on the Controls, your improvement actions, and Microsoft actions.  

1. From the top-left of the page, above where it says Assessments (the breadcrumb), select **Assessments** to return to the assessments page.  Before leaving the assessments tab, note that you can add your own assessments.

1. From the top of the page, select **Regulations**.  This page lists the regulations available to your organization. You can also create assessments from the available templates.  Select one of the premium templates from the list.  You will see specific information about that regulation including controls,  your improvement actions, and Microsoft action.  From the top-right corner of the window, select the **ellipses** to see the option for **+ Create assessment**, that allows you to create an assessment based on the template.  Return to the regulations page by select **Regulations** from the bread-crumb at the top of the page.

1. From the top of the page, select **Alerts**.   Here you can view and manage alerts for events that can affect your organization's compliance score.  If there is an alert listed, select it to view the information about the associated alert policy.

1. From the left navigation panel, select **Home** to return to the landing page of the Microsoft Purview compliance portal.
