# SC-900: Microsoft Security, Compliance, and Identity Fundamentals

This repository includes demo scripts and lab instructions for **SC-900T00: Microsoft Security, Compliance, and Identity Fundamentals**.  Both the demo scripts and labs assume access to the preconfigured WWL M365 Enterprise 2019 SPE_E5 tenant, available through an authorized lab hoster (ALH) and the use of an Azure subscription using an Azure pass.  The Azure pass is called for to ensure that the Azure subscription is setup using the same credentials as the Microsoft 365 tenant provided by the ALH (i.e., the Azure pass is redeemed using the same credentials as the Microsoft 365 tenant).  This enables a more seamless experience when moving between Microsoft 365 and Azure.  Demo scripts and lab instructions may be run on a user's own Microsoft 365 tenant and Azure subscription, but are not guaranteed, as some features may not be enabled with a user's personal subscription.

The user interfaces (UI) for Microsoft 365 and Azure are continually being updated.  As these changes happen every effort is made to ensure demo and lab steps are updated to reflect changes, but it is not uncommon to see variances in the UI described in the labs/demos and the actual tenant. 

- The demos are intended to be used by instructors to demonstrate functionality, in a live environment, during course delivery.  

- The labs are available as a supplement to the course content. These labs are intended for the case where learning partners are able to make the environment available to learners, for an extended period of time, after the 1-day course delivery, as there is not sufficient time for instructors to cover the course content and for students to complete labs, during the course delivery. The labs are designed as stand-alone labs (there is no dependency between labs).

## What are we doing?

- To support this course, we will need to make frequent updates to the course content to keep it current with the Azure services used in the course.  We are publishing the lab instructions and lab files on GitHub to allow for open contributions between the course authors and MCTs to keep the content current with changes in the Azure platform.

- We hope that this brings a sense of collaboration to the labs like we've never had before - when Azure changes and you find it first during a live delivery, go ahead and make an enhancement right in the lab source.  Help your fellow MCTs.

## How should I use these files relative to the released MOC files?

- The instructor handbook and PowerPoints are still going to be your primary source for teaching the course content.

- These files on GitHub are designed to be used in conjunction with the student handbook, but are in GitHub as a central repository so MCTs and course authors can have a shared source for the latest lab files.

- It will be recommended that for every delivery, trainers check GitHub for any changes that may have been made to support the latest Azure services, and get the latest files for their delivery.

## What about changes to the student handbook?

- We will review the student handbook on a quarterly basis and update through the normal MOC release channels as needed.

## How do I contribute?

- Any MCT can submit a pull request to the code or content in the GitHub repo, Microsoft and the course author will triage and include content and lab code changes as needed.

- You can submit bugs, changes, improvement and ideas.  Find a new Azure feature before we have?  Submit a new demo!

## Notes

### Classroom Materials

It is strongly recommended that MCTs and Partners access these materials and in turn, provide them separately to students.  Pointing students directly to GitHub to access Lab steps as part of an ongoing class will require them to access yet another UI as part of the course, contributing to a confusing experience for the student. An explanation to the student regarding why they are receiving separate Lab instructions can highlight the nature of an always-changing cloud-based interface and platform. Microsoft Learning support for accessing files on GitHub and support for navigation of the GitHub site is limited to MCTs teaching this course only.
